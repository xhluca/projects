t-SNE is a visualization algorithm that projects your high-dimensional data into a 2D or 3D space so that you can explore the spatial distribution of your data. The t-SNE Explorer lets you interactively explore iconic image datasets such as MNIST, and state-of-the-art word embeddings such as GloVe, with all the computation done ahead of time. Data point previews and graphs help you better understand the dataset.
